# Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio is a collection of notebooks and presentations that I have completed to showcase my data analysis skills.

## Capstone Projects
<b>Predicting Home Foreclosures</b>
<p>Predicted which mortgages would likely foreclose using a large Sallie Mae dataset. The random forest classifier in Python 3 scikit learn  was used to assign each mortgage into one of two classes, non-foreclosure and foreclosure. Undersampling was applied since a class imblance of non defaults existed in the dataset.

<p>Created recommendation engine using the Surprise library on Yelp dataset. PostgreSQL used along with Python 3 to prepocess original data. A matrix factorization singular value decomposition algorithm was used to make restaurant recommendations on test set.
